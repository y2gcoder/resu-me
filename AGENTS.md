## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `frontend/`: Next.js + TypeScript app. Co-locate route handlers and UI under `app/` (or `src/` if adopted), mirror API paths inside `app/api`, and keep shared utilities in `frontend/lib/`. Co-locate component tests as `*.test.tsx` beside the source, and e2e specs under `frontend/e2e/`. Add a short README for any sub-module that spans more than one screen of context.
- `backend/`: FastAPI service. Keep routers in `backend/app/api/`, schemas in `backend/app/schemas/`, and services in `backend/app/services/`. Centralize settings in `backend/app/core/config.py`, load secrets via environment variables or `.env` (never commit secrets), and group tests under `backend/tests/` with fixtures in `backend/tests/conftest.py`.
- `docs/`: Product and technical source of truth (PRD, API spec, glossary). Update the relevant doc in the same PR whenever behavior changes, and cross-link from your PR description.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `docker compose up`: Bring up the application stack (frontend, backend, databases, supporting services) for end-to-end validation.
- Frontend:
  - `cd frontend && pnpm install && pnpm dev`: Install dependencies and run the Next.js dev server.
  - `cd frontend && pnpm lint`: Run Biome in lint + format-check mode.
  - `cd frontend && pnpm test`: Execute the Vitest suite (consider `--watch` during development).
  - `cd frontend && pnpm exec playwright test`: Run Playwright end-to-end specs when they exist.
- Backend:
  - `cd backend && uv sync`: Install Python dependencies using uv (use `uv venv` if a virtualenv is needed).
  - `cd backend && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload`: Start the FastAPI dev server with auto-reload.
  - `cd backend && uv run pytest --cov`: Execute the Pytest suite with coverage enabled.
  - `cd backend && uv run ruff check` / `uv run ruff format --check`: Lint and ensure formatting with Ruff.
  - `cd backend && uv run mypy`: Perform static type checking.
- `make format` and `make check`: Provide composite entry points that wrap the commands above (keep them in sync with the tooling choices).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Python: Ruff + mypy as the canonical toolchain; 4-space indentation, snake_case modules, CamelCase Pydantic models, and explicit type hints on public APIs. See `backend/CODING_STYLE.md` for detailed conventions (async patterns, router/service structure, Playwright workflow, S3 uploads).
- TypeScript/React: Biome with `next/core-web-vitals`; components in PascalCase, hooks/utilities in camelCase, styles as `Component.module.scss`, and named exports. See `frontend/CODING_STYLE.md` for App Router structure, client/server component rules, TanStack Query patterns, and Tailwind/shadcn usage.
- Shared: Keep API routes kebab-case (e.g., `/resume-builder`), database tables snake_case, and prefix feature flags/configuration keys with `RESUME_*`. Document non-trivial behaviour in `/docs` or the per-project coding style guides.

## Testing Guidelines

- Backend: Organise tests under `backend/tests/`, mirroring router paths (`test_api_resume.py`). Maintain fixtures in `backend/tests/conftest.py`, target â‰¥80% coverage on new code, and run `uv run pytest --cov` before opening a PR. Add Ruff/mypy to CI to prevent regressions.
- Frontend: Colocate Vitest specs as `Component.test.tsx` beside components and run them with `pnpm test`. Use Testing Library patterns, and introduce Playwright specs under `frontend/e2e/` for multi-step flows (`pnpm exec playwright test`).
- Document any manual verification steps in the PR checklist whenever automated coverage is not feasible.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Follow the existing conventional prefix pattern (`docs:`, `feature/`, `ci:`). Use imperative mood and include the GitHub issue or PR number in parentheses when applicable (`feature/api spec (#14)`).
- Keep commits focused; squash fixups before pushing.
- Pull requests must describe scope, testing performed, and affected docs. Attach screenshots or curl examples for new endpoints/UI. Request reviews from domain owners (backend, frontend, docs) and link relevant doc updates.

## Documentation & Knowledge Base

- Treat `/docs` as canonical. When behavior changes, update the relevant doc in the same PR.
- Capture architecture decisions in `docs/adr/` (create the directory if absent) to keep rationales searchable for future agents.
